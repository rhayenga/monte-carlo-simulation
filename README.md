# Monte Carlo & SMA Crossover Backtest

This project explores two quantitative finance techniques using Python in [QuantConnect](https://www.quantconnect.com/):

- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Models possible future price paths of Ralph Lauren (RL) stock.  
- **SMA Crossover Backtest**: Tests a 10-day vs. 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) trading strategy to evaluate historical performance and risk.

## Project Overview
I built this project to strengthen my programming and quantitative finance skills:  
- Learned how to implement Monte Carlo simulations in Python.  
- Gained experience with backtesting trading strategies.  
- Developed a better understanding of Python functions, syntax, and files.
- Important Note: This project will only be able to be run in QuantConnect. This code needs (Lean Engine) for backtesting and needs to be able to access QuantConnect's free API. 

When I started, I had minimal Python experience — this project was a great interactive way to learn both coding and market modeling.

## Tools & Libraries
- **QuantConnect (Lean Engine)** for backtesting  
- **Python** for coding simulations and strategies
